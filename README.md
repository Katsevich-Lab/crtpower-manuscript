# On the power of conditional independence testing under model-X

This repository contains code to reproduce the simulation study in the following paper:

Eugene Katsevich and Aaditya Ramdas. On the power of conditional independence testing under model-X. Electronic Journal of Statistics, 2022. Available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05506).

The simulation and plotting code is in `simulation.R`; auxiliary functions are in `simulation_functions.R`. The results underlying Figure 1 (`in-sample.png`) are contained in `in_sample_results.RDS`. The results underlying Figure 2 (`out-of-sample.png`) are contained in `out_sample_results.RDS`.
